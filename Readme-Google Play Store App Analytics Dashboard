Google Play Store App Analytics Dashboard
# Executive Summary

The Google Play Store Analytics Dashboard provides a data-driven view of the mobile app ecosystem, helping uncover insights into app performance, user ratings, and monetization patterns.
This project aims to identify trends that influence app popularity, ratings, and installs, helping developers, marketers, and analysts make informed strategic decisions.

Built using Power BI, the dashboard offers interactive visualizations covering app categories, pricing types, reviews, and ratings, presenting a unified view of market dynamics across thousands of Play Store apps.

# Project Objective

To analyze and visualize the Google Play Store dataset to:

Understand factors influencing app ratings and reviews.

Identify top-performing app categories by installs and sentiment.

Compare Free vs Paid app performance across genres.

Explore relationships between pricing, size, and popularity.

Provide actionable recommendations for app developers and marketers.

# Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of multiple interactive visual sections designed to explore different perspectives of app performance:

#️⃣ Overview Page

High-level KPIs: Total Apps, Total Free Apps, Total Paid Apps, Total Category, Total Genre, Average Rating, Average Review & Average Reveiw per App.

Segmentation by App Type (Free vs Paid) and Content Rating (Everyone, Teen, Mature).

Slicers for Category, Genre, and Rating Range.

#️⃣ Category Analysis

Bar chart of Top 10 Categories by Average Rating.

Distribution of apps across categories to highlight over & underrepresented segments.

Comparison between category popularity and average installs.

#️⃣ Rating & Review Analysis

Scatter plots showing the relationship between Ratings and Reviews.

KPI cards showing Average Reviews per App and Average Rating per App Type.

Trend analysis of rating consistency and user engagement.

#️⃣ Paid vs Free Insights

Breakdown of Revenue-Generating (Paid) vs Free apps.

Pricing distribution visualization to understand market affordability.

Comparison of user satisfaction across paid and free versions.

# Key Metrics & Measures (DAX Highlights)

Some of the key DAX measures used in this project include:

Total Apps = COUNTROWS(apps)

Avg Rating = AVERAGE(apps[Rating])

Total Reviews = SUM(apps[Reviews])

Avg Review per App = DIVIDE(SUM(apps[Reviews]), [Total Apps], 0)

Avg Rating per App Type = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(apps[Rating]),
    apps[Type] = "Free" || apps[Type] = "Paid"
)


Each measure was validated for accuracy and used in visuals to reflect rating consistency, popularity trends, and user sentiment.

# Key Insights

Top Categories: “Family,” “Game,” and “Tools” dominate both app volume and installs.

User Ratings: Apps with higher update frequency and smaller sizes tend to achieve higher ratings.

Paid Apps: Though fewer in number, they have higher average ratings and review quality compared to free apps.

Review Patterns: A small percentage of apps accumulate most of the total reviews, highlighting power-law engagement behavior.

App Size vs Rating: Very large-sized apps tend to have lower ratings, likely due to performance and storage concerns.

# Recommendations

Optimize app size and update frequency to maintain rating consistency.

Enhance monetization strategies for mid-tier paid apps to improve conversion.

Target high-growth categories like Education, Health & Fitness, and Productivity for better retention.

Incorporate user feedback loops to address poor reviews faster.

Leverage visual storytelling dashboards for continuous product performance monitoring.
